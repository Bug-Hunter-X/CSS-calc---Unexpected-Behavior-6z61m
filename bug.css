The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit mixing. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 10px + 20%);` might not behave as you anticipate because the order of operations may not be what you expect, and you're mixing percentages and pixels. Another issue can arise with nested `calc()` expressions that might cause errors if not written carefully.
